## 🔍 Enhanced Features (NERO-Specific)

| Feature | NERO Tech Used | User Benefit |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Gasless Transactions | Paymaster Sponsorship | Zero-friction DeFi |
| Token-as-Gas | Flexible Fee Logic | Pay fees in any token |
| Secure Legacy Plans | AA Time-Locks + Blockspace 2.0 | MEV-protected transfers |

## 📊 Metrics for Success

**Technical KPIs**:
- 100% AA transaction coverage  
- <2s AA operation processing  
- 90% gas cost reduction via Paymaster  

**Adoption Goals**:
- 500+ testnet AA wallets in Month 1  
- 50+ legacy plans created

## 🌟 Why This Stands Out

1. **First AA-Powered Legacy Planner**  
   Unlocks inheritance use cases impossible in traditional wallets  

2. **NERO-Specific Optimization**  
   Custom-built for Blockspace 2.0 architecture  

3. **Mass Adoption Focus**  
   Removes all Web3 friction points via AA
